# tdd-hello-nunit
##TDD Example project in C# with NUnit
======================================
I created this project as a learning aid for my CodeMentor 
students studying TDD with NUnit, Moq, and C#.  
The project is a simple console application with a few 
additional features to show how more advanced aspects of 
TDD work.
